# BCG: Introduction To Consulting
In this online program, I got to complete similar work that consultants do at BCG. I gained enviable insight into what it’s like to solve meaningful challenges with our diverse and forward-thinking team. I got to learn what thinking outside the box actually means, how an idea which is considered irrelevant by bunch of people can be a game changer for the organisations.

## Task 1: Challenge your Mental Models

In this task I learned through a TED Talk from BCG Partner & Director Alan Iny, (“Alan Iny: Reigniting Creativity in Business” linked below), which provides a great overview into how BCG thinks about creativity and the key role played by doubt, also read an article titled “Breaking Through: Proven Idea-Generation Practices". I made a presentation based on my learnings.

## Task 2: Building New Boxes

I was asked to generate ideas to help a fictional luxury clothing company increase sales revenue. I learned about framing effective questions, creating conditions that aid creativity, revealing and doubting your current assumptions (or “boxes”), building new ones, and generating ideas within those new boxes.  I made a presentation containing all the questions, issues and mitigations.
